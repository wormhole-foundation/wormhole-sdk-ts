# Wormhole SDK Documentation

This folder contains versioned documentation generated by [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) for the Wormhole TypeScript SDK.

## Folder Structure

- `latest/` – The most recent version of the documentation (always regenerated)
- `v1/`, `v2/`, etc. – Snapshots of `latest/` taken at each major version bump
- `.version` – Internal file used by the docs script to track the last version that was built

## How to Update the Docs

Follow these steps whenever you need to update the documentation:

1. Bump the SDK version in `package.json` (e.g., from `2.2.0` to `2.3.0`).

    ```json
    {
    "version": "2.3.0"
    }
    ```

    The docs script uses this to determine whether a new major version was released.

2. Run the docs generator:

    ```bash
    npm run docs
    ```

    This will generate the latest documentation in the `latest/` folder.
    
    If you've bumped to a new major version (e.g. v2 → v3), it will:
    - Copy the existing `docs/latest/` into `docs/v2/` (only if `v2/` doesn’t already exist)
    - Generate new docs into `docs/latest/`
    - Update `.version` to track the new version

## Available Documentation Versions

| Version | Description            | Path              |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|
| v1      | First stable release   | [`docs/v1/`](./v1) |
| latest (v2)  | Current version        | [`docs/latest/`](https://wormhole-foundation.github.io/wormhole-sdk-ts/index.html) |

## Best Practices

- Don’t manually edit files inside `docs/latest/` or `docs/vX/`
- Always bump `package.json` before running `npm run docs`
- Keep `.version` tracked in Git so the script can detect version bumps correctly
